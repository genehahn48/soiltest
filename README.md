## Topic
1. Design a map using Kentucky soil test data showing nutrient trend by county from 1991 to 2012. Maybe able to get updated database file to include up to 2018.

2. Use county fertilizer sales to analyze mass balance of nutrients being applied to fields and exported out as crops.

## Questions
1. Use the AGR-1 nutrient recommendation categories for each nutrient to create bar graph for each County by year to see trend in direction soil nutrient is going across the State and verify University of Kentucky recommendations are adequate to maintain soil nutrient levels?
    The nutrient levels should be in the medium range for productive crop growth.

2. Does the import of nutrients into the State exceed export of harvested crops?
    This mass balance may be not be possible due to Kentucky have river ports that import fertilizer and farmers from other counties pickup at port then cross countyline where product is applied. This will skew data analysis where port Counties have surplus of nutrients.

## Significance
The significance of the map will help determine if the nutrients are being used efficiently and show that Kentucky is doing it's part in curbing pollution runoff with excessive nutrient application. Also determine if AGR-1 recommendations may need to be updated due to higher yielding hybrid seed.
